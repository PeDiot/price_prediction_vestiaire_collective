# Decision Support for Pricing of Second-Hand Items

[Vestiaire Collective](https://fr.vestiairecollective.com/) is a platform on which second-hand fashion items are traded. Its objective is to connect sellers and buyers while certifying the authenticity of the products offered by the sellers. This platform allows to remove the problem of asymetric information related to the sale of luxury products.

This project aims to help sellers set the right price when they want to put an item on sale on Vestiaire Collective. 

The algorithm's prediction allows sellers to avoid wasting time in setting the price. This decision support maximizes his profits :
- by preventing him from selling at too low a price, 
- by preventing him from not finding buyers because his price is too high.

By helping sellers setting the "right" price, the algorithm allows buyers to find items sold at a price close to their willingness to pay.

For Vestiaire Collective, the price prediction tool ensures the volume and speed of transactions. The more transactions there are on the platform, the more commissions Vestiaire Collective receives. It also enhance user satisfaction: buyers find items that are priced to generate a surplus and sellers save time selling their items.
